		<h3>Research-Based Projects</h3>
		<h4>Human Rights</h4>
		<p>Human Rights..? What are they? ...And where did they come from? In this project, you will investigate the International Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other conventions, such as the Convention on the Rghts of a Child. You may not be aware of this, but this International Declaration of Human Rights affects all of us in a big way and often, we may not realise just how important it is to our lives today.</p>
		<h5>Key questions that you'll need to answer.</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>What is the United Nations? When and why was it established? What does it do?</li>
				<li>What is the Unversal Declaration of Human Rights?</li>
				<li>What are Rights and Responsibilities? How are they similar and how are they different?</li>
				<li>Read the Rights of the Child. Which Child Right do you think is most important? Why? According to the Convention, who has responsibility for protecting children?</li>
					<li>What is UNICEF and what do they do?</li>
