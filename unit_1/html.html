		<h1>Giving it a go</h1>
		<p>This website is designed to showcase my learning in HTML, CSS and Webdesign.</p>
		<h2>Unit 1</h2> 
		<p>So far I have been enjoying Unit 1 of this General Assembly course. I don't know what it is about webdesign and coding that has been s enjoyable, perhaps its the fomulaic nature of coding that has me really excited and engaged. I have to say that the lectures have been very clear and easy to follow.</p>
		<p>I'm not yet sure what I'd like my final product to be. Here are some ideas and options: </p> 

		<ol>Personal blog. I don't have one yet, and am not sure what I would write about. Additionally, I'm sure I don't need to create a new website in order to start one. However, it would be fun to develop and design a blog my way.</ol>
		<ol>Language classes. I am currently teaching English Language to International high school students. Perhaps I can share my knowledge and skills digitally, without having to allocate a lot of face-to-face time.</ol>
		<ol>Resource for current students. Perhaps I can design a website with supplementary material for my current students to support them on their language learning journey.
