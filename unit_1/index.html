		<h1>Giving it a go</h1>
		<p>This website is designed to showcase my learning in HTML, CSS and Webdesign.</p>
		<h2>Unit 1</h2> 
		<p>So far I have been enjoying Unit 1 of this General Assembly course. I don't know what it is about web design and coding that has been so enjoyable. Perhaps it's the fomulaic nature of coding that has me really excited and engaged. I have to say that the lectures have been very clear and easy to follow.</p>
		<p>I'm not yet sure what I'd like my final product to be. Here are some ideas and options: </p> 
		<ol>
			<li>Personal blog. I don't have one yet, and am not sure what I would write about. I'm sure I don't need to create a new website in order to start a blog as there are already existing sites, such as weebly and wordpress. However, it would be fun to develop and design a blog my way.</li>
			<li>Resource for current students. I am currently teaching English Language to International High School students, preparing them for the challenges and content that they'll face when they get to High School. Perhaps I can design a website with supplementary material for my current students to support them on their language learning journey.</li>  
			<li>Language classes. The final idea I have at this point is to develop a learning resource for my local community. Perhaps I can share my knowledge and skills as an English language and High School teacher digitally with the broader community, without having to allocate a lot of face-to-face time. I have been interested in working with the local and broader community, helping more students access the learning resources they need.</li>
			<li>More options to come.</li>
