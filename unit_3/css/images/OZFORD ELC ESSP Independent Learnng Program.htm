		<h1>What is Independent Learning?</h1>
		<p>Independent Learning is when you learn new things through your own effort and thinking. It allows you to choose topics of interest and in doing so, better understand yourself. Through the process of Independent Learning, you will come to understand your strengths and weaknesses and then be able to set your own learning goals to improve your language skills and knowledge.</p>
		<p>Check out the About section for more info about the assessments you must complete as part of this program.</p>
		<p>The projects on this website will help you learn some vital skills and build your English language knowledge in a fun and challenging way. Importantly, you will learn to be a self-directed learner, which will help you be successful in High School and beyond. Here you'll find a number of projects to inspire you.</p>
		<p>When you're ready to start working on your project, check out the Projects section for a range of topics to choose from or some tips to help you design your own.</p>
